    <h1>The Trial</h1>
    <h3> Socrates’ Trial</h3>
    <p>Within Apology, Plato’s dialogue, Socrates faced trial and had to defend himself against the charge of impiety and corruption 
        of the youths. However, within his defence, Socrates attempts to first exonerate himself of the preconceptions held by the jury. 
        Unfortunately for Socrates, the persons within this jury held biases against Socrates that would pose a problem if they 
        were not first addressed. These preconceptions were passed from parent to child and reiterated amongst friends, permeating throughout society 
        and creating an inaccurate image of Socrates. He saw this as a more dangerous issue as his prosecutor in this case was faceless but had implicated
        him more severely. 
     </p>

    <h3> Socrates’ Stance </h3>
    <p> 
        During his trial, Socrates had the option of either adapting a new way of representing and expressing himself or maintaining his 
        accustomed to. implications. He opted to maintain is mode of communication and enquiry throughout his trial.
        Initially I viewed Socrates’ position as an inability to adapt or adjust to his situation (his trial) which, unfortunately, 
        led to his death. His rashness could certainly offend any juror and he presented his defence with very little tact. I was disappointed 
        in his inflexibility and thought more could have been done to save his life.  However, my professor, Dr. Michael Griffin, proposed another way 
        of viewing this trial. Instead of inflexibility, it can be argued that Socrates demonstrated integrity. Instead of yielding to the
         emotions of the men of the jury, he remained adamant that he would speak the truth – his truth. He refused to formulate his speech in 
         any way that will detract from his authenticity and his authentic self remained on display until his dying breath. <br/></br>
        I can view Socrates’ stance as either noble or stupid. I realise that I am in a situation where I can either take Socrates’ action as an 
        example for my own life or regard him as an example of “what not to do” – adapt or remain consistent. 
 </p>


    <h3> My Trial  </h3>
    <p></p>Similar to Socrates, I too face dangerous charges from a faceless opponent. A case was made against me, even before I 
    left home or dreamt of leaving home. A claim that I was loud and disruptive. A claim that I was aggressive. A claim that I was
     uncultured.  I was already implicated, either because of my Jamaican heritage or my skin colour. No single person had implicated
      me, but at the same time, everyone did. This case was produced solely on the stereotypes that permeate the North American cultures. 
      This case, I cannot defend myself against as strongly as Socrates did in his trial. I must plead guilty, because I am. I am guilty of being loud. I 
      am guilty of having aggression be the form through which I easily express my emotions – my frustration, my annoyance and even my 
      love. I am guilty of being open and honest to the point of being tactless. I am guilty. </br>

    <p>
        Because of this guilt, I am forced to choose between adapting and being true to myself and to my culture. 
        As I am typing this,I wonder what does “being true to oneself” even mean? For Socrates, 
        it meant that he would express himself in the way that was comfortable to him. He would speak the truth, 
        his truth, and whatever the consequences may be, his conscience was clear. However, there is a crucial difference between 
        Socrates and I. Socrates was seventy years old. His life experience far surpasses mine. He had learnt about himself, about his essence. 
        He was self-aware and self-assured. I on the other hand, I am just beginning to create my identity. Would it not 
        be silly to remain loyal to traits I do not even wish to possess? Is it not silly to talk about my integrity when I don’t have 
        a true reason to remain changeless/consistent? Is it because I am holding on to the pieces of me that were certain? But nothing in this 
        life is certain. Is it that I need consistency and familiarity in this new life? Is it that I refuse to fit the mould my 
        prosecutors would have preferred me to fit?  I am uncertain and this uncertainty would mean my decision to remain unchanging would be arbitrary. 
         I would not be acting with integrity; “integrity” would lose its meaning. Alas, my path and my stance 
        turns out to be different from that of Socrates. 
   
   </p> 
   <p>
        I was hoping that through introspection, this piece would be concluded with my integrity being maintained, 
        similar to Socrates’. I had hoped that my final decision would be that I remain “true to myself” and my culture and 
        refuse to fit any pre-defined mould. But unfortunately(?), things didn’t quite turn out that way. I cannot agree to maintain 
        any characteristic that is not enhancing my being. I refuse to perpetuate toxic traits because I am afraid of ‘losing my 
        culture’. How silly of me to even think this! My Jamaican heritage isn’t wrapped in aggression or vulgarity. It shines through 
        me whenever I take on a new challenge with a smile. It radiates through my laughs, love, honesty, acceptance and perseverance. 
        Deciding that traits no longer serve me is not equivalent to deciding that I am no longer Jamaican. I will continue to grow, 
        learn and become the person I am meant to be. I will change the things that are toxic and embrace the things that build me. 
        Hopefully, if I should be put on trial at seventy-years old, I too will be able to maintain my integrity as I will know what 
        I stand for.

   </p>
   <p>
        In the end, Socrates’ stance is neither an example of “what not to do” or what I should do currently (adapt or not). 
        Instead, I will take his actions as an example for the future.
 
   </p>
   <p>
        With this decision, I am at peace with myself – my sign does not oppose me (Socrates’ way of saying his conscience is clear). 
        I can only hope that the rest of my decisions will follow suit.

   </p>

        PS: This was not how I had planned this journal piece but it took on a life of its own. 
        It was necessary though. I needed it. Thank you for allowing me to do this.
